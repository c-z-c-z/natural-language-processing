# A preliminary demographically informed Toontown Rewritten NLP analysis

## Description and background

## Methodology, implementation

## Results and observations

## Repository contents
This repository contains a paper reporting on the analysis and its results, both demographic corpora used to create the extended demographic corpus, and a bibtex file. 

## Status
Due to major changes in the game's gender system, the difficulty of collecting large amounts of data by hand, and extremely similar results yielded across multiple studies, this specific research area has been indefinitely put on hold. There are some tentative plans to potentially use data from the demographic corpora in a machine learning context, but much strategization is necessary regarding this research direction, as well as plans to create something interactive and visual, such as a dashboard.
