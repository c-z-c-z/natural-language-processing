## Toontown Rewritten message corpus analysis
This project investigated and analyzed a corpus of 4000 chat messages from the MMORPG Toontown Rewritten collected by hand in March 2022. Analysis was carried out in Python using textblob and VADER. The folder contains two code files, the message corpus, a .txt file of all individual words in the corpus, and various plots created with matplotlib and seaborn

## Dota 2 message corpus analysis
This project was dedicated to the analysis of an extensive corpus of Dota 2 chat messages using VADER. The folder contains a code file, two .txt files consisting of all individual words in the corpus, various plots created with matplotlib and seaborn, as well as the dataset, which can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devinanzelmo/dota-2-matches 

## LDA and NMF analysis on Toontown Rewritten message corpus
In this project, I performed latent Dirichlet allocation and non-negative matrix factorization on my preexisting corpus of 4000 Toontown Rewritten chat messages. Analysis was carried out in Python using scikit-learn and VADER. The folder contains two code files and the message corpus

## LDA on extended TTR message corpus

## A preliminary demographically informed Toontown Rewritten NLP analysis
In this project, I carried out NLP analysis of a corpus sourced from the MMORPG Toontown Rewritten which consisted of 4000 chat messages and demographic information about the speaker of each message. This analysis was executed in R and an R Markdown report was generated in RStudio. The repository for this project contains the source R Markdown file and the document which it outputs, the corpus itself, a file containing a list of references used, and a README which provides more details about the background of the project and its results.

## An expanded demographically informed Toontown Rewritten NLP analysis
This project constitutes the next step in Toontown Rewritten NLP research. As the previous paper published in July 2023 uncovered few reportable results, an expanded analysis utilizing a much larger demographic corpus and examining a broader set of linguistic metrics was designed and performed in Python. The repository for the project contains a paper reporting on the study and its results, a bibtex file, both demographic corpora used to create an extended corpus, and a README which provides more details about the background of the project and its results.
